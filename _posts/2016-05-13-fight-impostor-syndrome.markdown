While sitting at my laptop deciding what to write only one thought came to mind:

> What does one write in their second blog post, when they feel they have nothing to share?  

I realized after sitting at my computer for nearly an hour that the reason I thoguht I had nothing to share was due to a character defect. Impostor Syndrome. Caltech's Counceling Center has an [online resource](https://counseling.caltech.edu/general/InfoandResources/Impostor) that describes impostor syndrome as:

> ...a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true. It is experienced internally as chronic self-doubt, and feelings of intellectual fraudulence.

I remember reading these words for the first time after hearing about impostor syndrome on the [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) podcast.  

It was as if I was reading the memoirs of my thoughts. There haven't been many times, in my introspective life, that I have had such a deep connection with a set of words written by another. Ususaly it is a small poem or persons emotional sharing of thoughts. But these clinical sentances took my mind by storm.  

I simultaniously felt exposed, understood, comforted, and afraid. I was listening to my coding heros explain how they faced a challenge I could not only comprehend but lived with on a dialy basis. 

Now that I could name it, I could tame it.

To be continued...
