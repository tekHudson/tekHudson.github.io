Ever wanted to have your, or others, Twitter posts containing links to your blog look a bit snazzier?  

![Improved Twitter Post]({{ site.url }}/images/improvedTwitterPost.png)

Here is the [Twitter dev site](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) for this feature. I needed more information so I scoured the web and combined information and came up with these simple steps:

> If you are using a default Jekyll project then just follow the instructions.  
> If not you may need to put code snippets in your corrisponding locations.

* Choose the image you want to have displayed on the Twitter post. This depends on which type of card you want:
  * Summary Card (Used for this demo) - At least 120px by 120px and no more than 1MB in size. For an expanded tweet and its detail page, the image will be cropped to a 4:3 aspect ratio and resized to be displayed at 120px by 90px. The image will also be cropped and resized to 120px by 120px for use in embedded tweets.
  * Summary Card with Large Image - At least 280px by 150px, and no more than 1MB in size.
  * Photo Card - All files must be below 1MB in size. Twitter will resize images, maintaining the original aspect ratio to fit the following maximum sizes:
    * Web: 375px by 435px
    * Mobile with a non-retina display375px by 280px
    * Mobile with a retina display 750px by 560px
  * Gallery Card - No exact size is specified, but aim for 200px by 200px as a minimum. Images cannot exceed 1MB in size.
  * App Card - App logo generated from your app ID. Image should be at least 800px by 320px, and can be in jpg, jpeg, png, or gif format.
  * Player Card - See [this page](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player) for more info
  * Product Card - 160px by 160px or greater with a 1:1 aspect ratio
  * Lead Generation Card - Should be at least 800px wide by 200px tall with a 4:1 aspect ratio. The maximum image size is 3 MB and you can crop and resize images after theyâ€™ve been uploaded.  Images can be in jpg, jpeg, png, or gif format.
  * Website Card - 800px by 320px and the image must be less than 3MB in size.
  * Coming Soon: Video Card - ???

* Place it into your images folder.
  * If you don't have an images folder make a folder named `images` in your root project directory and put it there.
* Add the following code to your `_includes/head.html`

{% highlight html linenos %}
{% raw %}
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@TekHudson" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="{% if page.title %}{{ page.title | escape }}{% else %}{{ site.title | escape }}{% endif %}" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="{% if page.description %}{{ page.description | escape }}{% else %}{{ site.description | escape }}{% endif %}" />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="http://blog.tekkedout.net/images/blogIcon.png" />
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

* You may notice the use of `page.title` and `page.description` in this code. You probably already have a `title` on all your posts. The `description` will likely need to be added to any post you want to utilize the card as this is a required field for it to function correctly on Twitters end.
