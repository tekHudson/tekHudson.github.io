**Trigger warning:** This post contains a description of a recent panic attack I endured as it relates to my impostor syndrome.

Time for a check in.

Recently, impostor syndrome reared it's head hardcore as I stepped outside of my comfort zone. This happened shortly after leaving the company where I had my first coding position.

Before proceeding let's talk a little bit about my employment history.

I have had a lot of different jobs:
* Arcade Associate and Repair Technician
* Lifeguard
* Swim Instructor
* Valet
* Office Assistant
* Archivist
* Carpenter
* Metalworker
* Truck Driver
* Parts Delivery Person
* Body Shop Estimator
* Retail Floor Associate
* Custom Framing Associate
* Custom Framing Lead
* Retail Department Manager
* Semi-Conductor Tooling Salesperson
* Customer Service Representative

My entrance into these positions were met with mild anticipation that was overwhelmed by the excitement of something new. Shortly after started I found the swing of things and began contributing on a daily basis and felt the rewards of a good days work. While some exerted a mild (or occasionally moderate) mental load, nothing was ever too intense. It stayed this way from age 13 till 29.

A mere 14 days before my 30th birthday I left behind these jobs and began a career as a Software Engineer.

At first there was trepidation as usual. However, by now it was expected and quickly dismissed as I dove into the training material provided. I poured through the material and astounded my manager, trainer, and myself, with my pace. I think we were all surprised since I have no CS degree and only one C++ course in high school and one HTML/CSS course in college.

I wish I could say I felt proud, but I didn't. I felt something else though.

Passion.

I felt a passion I hadn't known since 6th grade. That was the last time I had felt such a desire and drive to learn. It was overwhelming in the best possible way. Day in and day out I was using a muscle to a degree I hadn't in years. My mind stretched and grew to understand new ways of approaching problems and structures for solutions.

My time as a 'new hire' was extremely limited and I quickly became a strong participating member of the team. It didn't take long for me to surpass my and my managers expectations and earn a leadership role. Here I guided the team through transition to Agile development and set in place new standards for many aspects of our daily work flow.

While maintaining my contributions I was frustrated by a couple of work flow issues. A senior developer suggested I write a tool to ease that frustration. Enter Ruby. I had never used Ruby before. Once again I found my self diving in thirsty for knowledge. There was no fear or trepidation, only excitement.

The tools I created were noticed by the CTO and my grooming for joining the development team began. It was after the transition to a software developer, as opposed to XML engineer, that I first truly experience impostor syndrome.

The sense that I didn't deserve to be where I was and that someone would find out that I was a fake and I would be laughed out of the first career I'd ever had.

#### Flash forward to my first week at my second development job

Its the end of the week. Things have gone well. I'm setup and in the codebase. Reviewing a couple tickets and pushing commits to branches. People are introducing themselves to me and we are having good casual conversations. All in all, it's been better than I expected. Little did I know my impostor syndrome was doing push-ups in the background.

On Friday we had a company wide team building exercise where we were grouped with people from around the company and did an awesome local scavenger hunt customized to our offices location.

I got to know more people and learn about them. They in turn learned a little about me and we walk around the blocks near to our office looking for all sorts of landmarks and answering pub trivia style questions.

When we returned to the office I was tired mentally and physically. They had an open bar with cheese platters and an ice cream station.

I don't drink, can't eat cheese or ice cream.

Cue the impostor syndrome and anxiety attack.

I left the group at the front of the office and found my self in the back of the office in a corner, hyperventilating and crying.

"Your a sham."
"You can't drink like them."
"You can't even eat their food."
"You didn't commit any code this week did you."
"Your a freeloader."
"They're going to notice."
"Just leave now and limit your shame."
"Accept that your a failure and go home before this gets worse."

This is what goes through my mind when my impostor syndrome is kicking my ass. And in that moment it had me on the ropes and the referee was laughing as it pummeled me.

Breath. Just breath. Focus on the breath. Nothing else exists.
In for 3. Out for 3. In for 3. Out for 3. In for 3. Out for 3.
Gratitude list:
* I have a job
* My bills are paid
* I have shelter
* I have food
* I have a loving wife
* I have loving parents
* I have loving pets
* I have health
* I am still clean & sober

My heart rate drops. The all consuming haze of desperations begins to clear.

Impostor syndrome can kick my ass, but I learn the tools to address it and keep them close at hand.

Years ago I would fall into months long episodes of depression. Today I can sense I'm in depression within 24 hours usually and take actions to prevent it from becoming debilitating.

My goal is to do the same with impostor syndrome. I will do the same. I will overcome this disease. Why disease, cause there is no cure and it takes continual treatment to keep it at bay.

If you are suffering through similar conditions know that you are not alone and this didn't happen over night. I've been living a life of introspection for over 14 years. It's one hurdle at a time. Life isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. Pace your self and make sure to hit all the water stations to fill up.
